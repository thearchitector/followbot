      <h1>Sprint 1</h1>
      <p>For Sprint 1 our goal was to have a robot that had
        functional legs and walk in a straight line. We did succeed in
        building functional legs.
      </p>
        <img src="" alt="cad of final leg">
      <p>Before we settled on this design (reference image above), we were
        deciding between a simple four bar linkage leg or l-shaped legs
        connected by a bar. After working with both legs we settled on the
        l-shaped legs connected by a bar. In our first iteration we lazer cut
        the legs, but they did not have enough support to bear the weight of
        the robot. As a result, we switched to 3-D printed legs.</p>
      <p>To get the legs to move we connected four servos to an Arduino Uno.
        The two servos attached towards the front of the robot were attached to
        the l-shaped legs connected by a bar. These two sets of legs would
        move in opposite directions, similar to how a four legged animal
        walks.
      </p>

      <p>
        At the center of the robot there was another set of servos, one
        on each side. Each servo had an l-shaped leg that helps lift the robot,
        so it can propel itself forward. However there was a flaw in our leg
        design, so the legs in the center of the robot were colliding with the
        legs connected by a bar. Thus the robot was unable to walk. As a result
        we were not able to fully reach our sprint goal.
