      <p>
        Entering our first 2-week sprint, we aimed to have a robot that had
        simplistic yet functional legs, as well as basic control software that
        would allow it to walk in a straight line. Before we began designing
        legs, we did research on various existing leg and walking designs. We
        examined various quadrapods such as Boston Dynamics’ “Spot”, which have
        at least two servos or motors per leg, and other, simpler designs that
        used four-bar linkages to bend and lift the legs. We also looked at
        quadrapods and hexapods that moved in a variety of ways, especially ones
        that were able to walk upstairs. We considered these designs because we
        are interested in having our robot have the ability to walk on rough
        terrain. Originally, we thought that it would be relatively simple to
        make a robot that could walk on four legs, but after talking to
        professors and NINJAs, we found that a six-legged design might be
        better, as it would allow our robot to be able to balance using only
        mechanical systems.
      </p>

      <p>
        We then explored two different leg types: L-shaped bars and a four-bar
        linkage for each leg. We eventually decided on the L-shaped bars, as it
        allowed us to be able to more easily control the robot, since we would
        be able to actuate the front and back legs with a single servo using
        only a connecting bar instead of a gear train. Additionally, this design
        made integration somewhat simpler both because the design was simpler
        and also because the servo location to distance traveled conversion is
        very simple.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because we initially set out to achieve a significant amount of progress
        in this sprint, we decided to simply prototype our robot rather than put
        a significant amount of time and effort into its fabrication. For a
        chassis, we found a relatively small cardboard box onto which we
        attached our legs and sensors. We decided to laser cut the legs from
        1/4” MDF fiberboard **I think** so we could relatively quickly get our
        robot prototype assembled. However, we quickly realized that the
        laser-cut legs and their mounts could not support the full weight of the
        electronics, so we ended up re-CADing an attachment and 3D printing the
        entire assembly.
      </p>

          alt="cad of final leg" style="width: 50%;">
      <p>
        To get the legs to move we connected four servos to an Arduino Uno. The
        two servos attached towards the front of the robot were attached to the
        L-shaped legs connected by a bar. These two sets of legs would move in
        opposite directions, similar to how a four-legged animal walks.
      </p>
      <img src="" alt="circuit diagram">
      <iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1h4OpD9kvh8DGfMvcL9A7NS6Y3_0QdDbC/preview"
          width="420" height="315"></iframe>
      <p>
        At the center of the robot there was another set of servos, one on each
        side. Each servo had an L-shaped leg that helps lift the robot, so it
        can reset the lateral legs on each side. However, there was a flaw in
        our leg design, so the center legs collided with the bar that connected
        the other legs. Therefore, our robot was unable to walk. As a result, we
        were not able to fully reach our sprint goal, though we did learn a
        significant amount about our mechanical design and improvements that we
        needed to make.
      </p>
      <p>During this sprint we learned about all the components that we need to
        focus on for Sprint 2. Our goals for Sprint 2 are as follows:
        <ul>
          <li>Create a data pipeline between laptop and robot computer to
            accelerate path planning algorithm development.</li>
          </li>
          <li>Redesign and fabricate new body of robot.</li>
          <li>Work on traction for legs to propel forward.</li>
          <li>Iterate on design of the legs so that there is a better range of
             motion, no unintended collision between parts, faster linear
             motion, and improved weight bearing.</li>
          <li>Do a more complete integration between sensing and mechanical
             movement.</li>
        </ul>
